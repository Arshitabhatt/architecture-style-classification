# Classification of Architecture style

This is a repo of an image classification project in which CNN model is used to classify 24 classes of architectural styles found around the world.This project is an implementation of transfer learning.
The original notebook is hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aarshibhatt112/architecture-style).
I have talked more about this on my medium blog [here](https://medium.com/@aarshibhatt112/what-is-the-architecture-style-of-this-building-6170566ad1c1)
